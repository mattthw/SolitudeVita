# Solitude

## Introduction
vitaQuake is a Quake engine source port for PSVITA.

vitaQuake Solitude is a port of Solitude for the vita. Solitude was originally made for the PSP, which was abandoned, then rebooted as Solitude Revamped, then abandoned, then ported to N3DS, then forgotten. This port is still a work in progress.

An official channel to discuss the development of this source port can be found on [Vita Nuova discord server](https://discord.gg/PyCaBx9).

## Features
- 4 Player bot Slayer matches (Free for all)
- Many maps
 - One new map (Citadel, a remake of the map from the third official game DLC- remade by me) - this one is probably the best looking while maintaining close to 60fps on the vita
 - One remade map (Narrows, credit to the original author: Scifiknux)
- New touchscreen aiming support

## Broken / WIP
- See [issues](https://github.com/mmccoy37/vitaQuake-Solitude/issues)

Place the Solitude folder inside ```<ux0 or alternative:>/data/Quake/```. You will also need the original quake files or shareware files as a .PAK filetype inside ```<ux0 or alternative:>/data/Quake/id1/```. You should be able to use the data files from VITADB for vitaQuake.
